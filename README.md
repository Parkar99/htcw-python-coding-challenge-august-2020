# [HowToCodeWell](https://howtocodewell.net/) Coding Challenge August 2020

### Level 1 - Find the duplicates in a Python Tuple
How many times is 1 duplicated in the following Tuple

```(1,1,2,3,4,1,5,6,7,1)```

For example `1` is in the Tuple `4` times

### Level 2 - Find the max and min of a Python Set

Print the max and min numbers of this set

```
set([15, 11, 8, 15, 32, 20])
```
For example minimum is `8` and maximum is `32`

### Level 3 - Count characters in a string

Create function that counts the characters in the string;

`Row Row Row Your Boat`

The function should return a dictionary where the index is the character, and it's value is character count.

For example `{'R': 3, 'B':1}`

`R` is found in the string `3` times, `B` is found in the string `1` time and so on
